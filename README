ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project implements a basic smart farming solution designed to automate environmental monitoring and control for optimal crop growth. The system utilizes various sensors and actuators managed by a microcontroller programmed in C.

Key Features:

Environmental Monitoring: Reading data from sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, soil moisture).

Automated Control: Actuating devices like pumps or fans based on sensor data (e.g., watering plants when soil is too dry).
